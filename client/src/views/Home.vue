          This app uses the official GW2 API to "snapshot" 
          the state of your account and compare it to the live state at some 
          point in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          The differences observed between these two states
          can be saved in this app, and/or downloaded as CSV.
        </p>
        <p>
          Records saved to the app can be tagged, and searched for later 
          reference, CSV download and reporting(soon).
